# Weight-height-breastfeeding-patterns-in-infants
According to the World Health Organisation, Breastfeeding is one of the most effective ways to ensure child health and survival. This work is investigate whether breastfeeding affects both heights and weights in infants. The data source is from:   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chidirolex/weightheight-and-breastfeeding-pattern-of-infants       

WHO recommendations, fewer than half of infants under 6 months old are exclusively breastfed.
Breastmilk is the ideal food for infants. It is safe, clean and contains antibodies which help protect against many common childhood illnesses. Breastmilk provides all the energy and nutrients that the infant needs for the first months of life, and it continues to provide up to half or more of a childâ€™s nutritional needs during the second half of the first year, and up to one third during the second year of life. 


# Data Source:

This data was collected from Braithwaite Memorial Specialist Hospital in Port Harcourt, Rivers State Nigeria back in 2015. The data contains information on four ways of breastfeeding babies and how it affects their growth and these include; Exclusive Breastfeeding, Breastfeeding with water, Partial Breastfeeding, and No Breastfeeding.

30 babies were selected for each feeding method, making 120 babies. The height and weight of each baby were measured in their first to sixth months. By looking at these measurements, anyone could understand how each feeding method influenced the babies' growth over those six months.

# Aim

the project aims to provide healthcare providers with valuable insights on how to support breastfeeding mothers. The project addresses the following research questions:

Are there any correlations between breastfeeding patterns and height?
Are there any associations between breastfeeding patterns and weight?
Is there a correlation between the height and weight of individuals?
How does the distribution of height and weight vary across different months?


# Data Cleaning

The Data was almost pre-processed from source, meaning that there was no regorous cleansing of the data (all the mess have been cleaned from kaggle) except for slight data transformations, filtering to remove blanks and ensuring that data type for each column fits in well. 

# Tools Employed:

Excel (Source file), Power BI
The use of Power BI to analyze breastfeeding and infant growth patterns reveals a range of competencies. The following are the main abilities shown in this analysis:

Data Transformation, 
Reporting and Dashboard Creation, 
Data Visualization, 
Insight Generation, and 
Contextual Interpretation




# DASHBOARD

The  Infant growth and breastfeeding patterns dashboard is shown below. (*Also note that the PBIX file is on this page You may freely download touse the dashboard). Alternatively, a jupyter notebook containing the python code for this analysis is also included.

# ANALYSIS


# Average weight by breastfeeding pattern


![Average_weight_by_breastfeeding_pattern](https://github.com/michaelegbujua/Weight-height-breastfeeding-patterns-in-infants/assets/40715460/6894f8b2-2910-4584-97b7-294604060b7a)

The following conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of the influence of breastfeeding practices on weight using a bar chart:

(1) The greatest average weight among the breastfeeding patterns taken into consideration is for Breastfeeding and Water (6.35kg). It implies that babies who receive both breastfeeding and water have a tendency to weigh a little bit more than babies who receive either one alone.

(2) Babies exclusively breastfed had a slightly lower average weight (6.26 kg) than babies exclusively breastfed in conjunction with water. This implies that the addition of water when breastfeeding may cause a small gain in weight.

(3) Average Weight for Partial Breastfed Babies (6.17kg): Babies who are partially breastfed typically weigh less than those who are exclusively breastfed as well as those who are breastfed according to the water pattern. This suggests that supplementing breast milk with non-breast milk substances like formula or solid foods may have a negligible effect on weight loss.

(4) The average weight of infants who are not breastfed (5.39 kg) is the lowest of the breastfeeding patterns examined. It implies that, compared to nursing habits, not breastfeeding and relying only on non-breast milk alternatives, such as formula feeding, may result in a significant loss of weight.
